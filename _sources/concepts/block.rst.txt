The central element of every cryptocurrency is a public ledger called the called blockchain, which links blocks together.

.. Each NEM block can contain up to ``N`` :doc:`transactions <transaction>`.

Since the blocks in the chain are ordered, the complete transaction history is held in the blockchain. Subsequent blocks in the blockchain have increasing heights that differ by one.

Blocks are stored in a database as permanent medium. NEM calls the first block in the chain the nemesis block.

NEM blocks complete every ``15`` seconds, making transactions confirm quickly enough for everyday use.

.. note:: Configuration parameters are `editable <https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server/blob/master/resources/config-network.properties>`_ . Public network configuration may differ.

**************
Block creation
**************

Blocks are created by accounts. The process of creating new blocks is called harvesting. The harvesting account - called the harvester - gets the fees for the transactions in the block. This gives the harvester an incentive to add as many transactions to the block as possible.

.. Any account that has a vested balance of at least N XEM is eligible to harvest.

    height; uint64; The height of the blockchain. Each blockchain has a unique height. Subsequent blocks differ in height by 1.
    timestamp; uint64; The number of seconds elapsed since the creation of the nemesis block.
    difficulty; uint64; The block difficulty.
    previousBlockHash; 32 bytes (binary); The hash of the previous block.
    blockTransactionHash; 32 bytes (binary); The transactions included in a block are hashed forming a |merkle|. The root of the tree summarizes them.
    stateHash; 32 bytes (binary); The state of the blockchain is stored in RocksDB for each block, forming a |patricia|. The root of the tree summarizes the state of the blockchain for a given block.
