MLMA allows a huge variety of business logic.

Manufacturing and Supply Chains
===============================

In this example, a manufacturer is shipping a pharmaceutical product.

The product receives its quality approval :doc:`mosaic <mosaic>` only when its blockchain record shows it has a production date, safety inspection, and was shipped at the correct temperature.

Sensors in the shipping container report temperature data every 5 minutes and consolidate it into a daily report.
