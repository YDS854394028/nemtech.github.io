Block
#####

The central element of every cryptocurrency is a public ledger called the called blockchain, which links blocks together.

.. Each NEM block can contain up to ``N`` :doc:`transactions <transaction>`.

Since the blocks in the chain are ordered, the complete transaction history is held in the blockchain. Subsequent blocks in the blockchain have increasing heights that differ by one.

Blocks are stored in a database as permanent medium. NEM calls the first block in the chain the nemesis block.

NEM blocks complete every ``15`` seconds, making transactions confirm quickly enough for everyday use.

Block creation
**************

Blocks are created by accounts. The process of creating new blocks is called harvesting. The harvesting account - called the harvester - gets the fees for the transactions in the block. This gives the harvester an incentive to add as many transactions to the block as possible.

.. Any account that has a vested balance of at least N XEM is eligible to harvest.

Properties
**********

Blocks are composed of the following properties:

    **Signature**

    The block signature. This is generated by the signer and can be used to validate that a node did not modify the block data.

    **Signer**

    The public key of the :doc:`harvester <account>` of the block.

    **Version**

    The version of the block. The higher byte represents the network identifier.

    .. csv-table::
      :header: "Id", "Version", "Description"
      :delim: ;

      0x68; MAIN_NET; Public main network
      0x98; TEST_NET; Public test network
      0x60; MIJIN; Private network
      0x90; MIJIN_TEST; Private test network

    **Type**

    The type of the block.

    .. csv-table::
      :header: "Id", "Type"
      :delim: ;

      0x8043; Nemesis Block
      0x8143; Block

    **Height**

    The height of the blockchain. Each blockchain has a unique height. Subsequent blocks differ in height by 1.


    **Timestamp**

    The number of seconds elapsed since the creation of the nemesis block.


    **Previous block hash**

    The ``Sha3-256`` hash of the last block, formatted in as a hexadecimal string.


    **Block transaction hash**

    The transactions included in a block are hashed forming a |merkle-tree|. The root of the tree summarizes them.
